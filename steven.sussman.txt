Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
A block element starts and is maintained within its own line.
An inline element does not create a new line and is used within the given width.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
It is moved to its own layer outside of its given container.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
By assigning a flex property to the element.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
Display Block:
1. <p> elements
2. <div> elements
3. <h> elements
Display inline:
1. <a> elements
2. <span> elements
Display inline-block:
1. <img> elements

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
The box model refers to the area (both visible and invisible) that surrounds all block elements. The makeup of the box model consists of 4 things:
Content - center of the box where the data is
Margin - distance between the border and the surrounding elements
Padding - distance between the border and the content
Border - the lining (visible or invisible) between the margin and padding.
We make the elements respect the parameters we've assigned through the use of flex. This allows us to "flex" or move around items to our will.
